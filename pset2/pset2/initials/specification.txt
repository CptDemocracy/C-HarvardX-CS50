PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this problem I was required to Write, in a file called initials.c, a program 
that prompts a user for their name (using GetString from the CS50 Library) and then 
outputs their initials in uppercase with no spaces or periods, followed by a newline (\n).

PROBLEM ASSUMPTIONS:

You may assume that the userâ€™s input will contain only letters (uppercase and/or lowercase) 
plus single spaces between words.
