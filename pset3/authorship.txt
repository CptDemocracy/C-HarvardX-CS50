My work includes the following units of code:

FILE: pset3/fifteen/fifteen.c
CODE UNITS:
- int main(int argc, char* argv[]);
- void clear(void);
- void greet(void);
- void init(void);
- void draw(void);
- bool move(int tile);
- bool won(void);
COMMENT:
The prototypes for the following code units were supplied with the PSET specification, 
however the actual code was written by me:
- void clear(void);
- void greet(void);
- void init(void);
- void draw(void);
- bool move(int tile);
- bool won(void);
