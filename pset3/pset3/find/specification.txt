PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this problem I was required to re-write the search function in declared helpers.h to find 
in such a way that it uses binary search, returning true if value provided by the user is in 
values and false if value is not in values.

Then my job was to write a sorting function, also declared in helpers.h, so that it has a time
complexity of O(n^2). I chose the Shellsort algorithm (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort).
