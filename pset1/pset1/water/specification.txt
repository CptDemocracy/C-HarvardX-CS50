PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this problem I was required to write, in a file called water.c, a program that 
prompts the user for the length of his or her shower in minutes (as a positive 
integer) and then prints the equivalent number of bottles of water (as an integer).

PROBLEM ASSUMPTIONS:

For simplicity, we could assume that the user would input a positive integer, so there 
was no need for error and overflow checking.
