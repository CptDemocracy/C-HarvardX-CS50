PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this problem I was required to write, in a file called mario.c, a program that 
recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks. The first prompt to the user
was for the half-pyramidâ€™s height - a non-negative integer no greater than 23. 
If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, my program
should re-prompt for the same again. Then, generate (with the help of printf and one
or more loops) the desired half-pyramid. I had to take care to align the bottom-left 
corner of the half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of the user's terminal window.
