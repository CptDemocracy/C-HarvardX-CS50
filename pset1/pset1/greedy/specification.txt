PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this problem I was required to write a program in a file called greedy.c that first 
asks the user how much change is owed and then displays the minimum number of coins with
which said change can be made. The specification requested that GetFloat from the CS50 
Library be used in order to get the user’s input and printf from the Standard I/O library 
to output the answer. 

PROBLEM ASSUMPTIONS:

For this problem we were allowed to assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), 
dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
