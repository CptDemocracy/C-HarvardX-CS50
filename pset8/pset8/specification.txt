PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this PSET, I was required to write a command-line
script in PHP in "import", that accepts as a command-line
argument the path to a file (the file assumed to be downloaded
from download.geonames.org/export/zip, for this problem, it was
the database of the US geonames), iterate over the file's lines,
inserting each as new row to the "places" MySQL table.

I was then required to implement search.php in such a way that it
outputs a JSON array of objects, each of which represents a row
from the "places" MySQL table, that matches the value of "geo" which
is a GET parameter passed into search.php.

Afterwards, I had to do a little front-end JS-scripting and modify 
the "configure" function so that the function properly lists geonames 
on the map, implement functions "addMarker", "hideInfo", "removeMarkers",
"search", "showInfo" and "update", which would provide front-end information
and list news in every specific locale, based on the back-end provided by
the CS50. 

My last assignment for this PSET was to add my "personal touch" to the
website. I chose this to be the "MyPlaces" and "Like" features, which 
would enable users to add their favorite places to their MyMaps collection 
by liking them on the main map (powered by Google Maps) on the index page. 
News will also be neatly displayed for users on their "MyPlaces" page.
