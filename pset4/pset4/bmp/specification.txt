PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

In whodunit.c, my assignment was to write a program that will remove the red
noise in clue.bmp, (that comes with the PSET) and thus reveal the identity
of the person in clue.bmp.

For resize.c, my job was to create a program that works from the console,
and resizes a bmp file by a factor specified by the user. The usage would
look like the one below:
  ./resize n infile outfile
Where:
- n is the multiplication factor, 
- infile is the file we are to enlarge
- outfile is the enlarged bmp file.
Notice, however, that infile and outfile have to be two separate instances,
if this is not the case, resize does not support such conversion.
