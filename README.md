PLEASE NOTE. A NOTE ON AUTHORSHIP:
Since most PSETs were provided with helper code which I assume no authorship of, every
PSET folder will contain a file, called:
  "authorship.txt"
, which will indicate what code is my solution to the problem and what code is helper
code that belongs solely to the CS50 staff.
