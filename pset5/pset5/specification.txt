PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For this problem, I was required to implement a data structure (whether
a hash table or a trie) to hold a word dictionary in a manner that will
enable the quickest possible access by the spell-checker provided by the 
CS50. I chose the data structure to be a hash table since I was more 
familiar with a hash table and believed that, despite the worst-case
O(n^2) for search, a good hashing algorithm would ensure the average-case
scenario which is O(1). 

As part of the hash table implementation, I also implemented my own hashing
function.
