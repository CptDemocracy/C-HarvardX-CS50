My work includes the following units of code:

FILE: pset5/questions.txt

FILE: pset5/HashSet.h
CODE UNITS:
- * // entire file is my work

FILE: pset5/HashSet.c
CODE UNITS:
- * // entire file is my work

FILE: pset5/List.h
CODE UNITS:
- * // entire file is my work

FILE: pset5/List.c
CODE UNITS:

FILE: pset5/PrimeHelper.h
CODE UNITS:
- * // entire file is my work
COMMENT:
This file was written by me, however, it is actually a port from the .NET Framework.
I can only assume credit for porting it into C to meet the PSET's needs.

- unsigned int size(void);
- bool unload(void);
