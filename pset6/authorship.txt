Woah, now this one's a biggie. The majory of code was provided by the CS50, and
also includes the backbone of the server, which I assume no authorship of.
Below are listed the parts that I actually worked on to meet the PSET requirements:

FILE: pset6/server.c
CODE UNITS:
- char* indexes(const char* path);
- bool load(FILE* file, BYTE** content, size_t* length);
- const char* lookup(const char* path);
- bool parse(const char* line, char* path, char* query);
COMMENT:
The functions listen in CODE UNITS that I worked on, had pre-supplied prototypes, 
however the actual code was written by me.
