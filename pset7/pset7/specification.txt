PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

For PSET 7, I was required to implement register.php
which would enable users to register on the website,
provided by the PSET. 

I was then required to empower users to look up quotes
for individual stocks by implementing a controller 
quote.php and two new HTML views, via which a user can
submit a stock's symbol and the second view, which displays
minimally the stock's latest price. (if passed an appropriate
value for the stock symbol).

My third assignment for this PSET was implementation of
a database to keep track of users' portfolios (collections
of stocks) that a registered user owns.

When all solutions to the problems listed above were presented,
I was required to implement the sell, buy and history functionalities,
which would enable our users to sell stocks, buy stocks, and watch
their stock trading history respectively.

As the icing on the cake, my final assignment for this PSET was
implementation of an extra feature, either empowering users, who
are already logged in to change their passwords, or implementing
a functionality that would enable users to deposit additional funds.
My choice was the password reset feature.

P.S. Fun trivia. I was actually writing this specification in my 
own words, as opposed to copy/pasting the PSET requirements off 
of their respective pages. For the last paragraph of my specification, 
willing to detract from the conventional "My nth assignment was to...", 
I decided to use "As the icing on the cake..." to begin my first sentence. 
How surprised I was to discover that the last paragraph in the original 
PSET spec started with "And ow the icing on the cake..."!
